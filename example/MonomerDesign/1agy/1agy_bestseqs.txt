# Comment lines start with the '#' symbol. Each designed sequence is written in one line with a few columns.
# 1st column: the lowest-energy sequence
# 2nd column: the index of the independent trajectory
# 3rd column: the ratio of designable positions recapitulated to be the native amino acid
# 4th column: the weighted total energy
# 5th column: the unweighted evolutionary-profile energy calculated based on PSSM
# 6th column: the unweighted physical energy
# 7th column: the unweighted binding energy. This energy value is a part of the physical energy in the 5th column, and it is zero for non-interaction design)
# 8th column: the number of unsatisfied catalytic constriants for enzyme design. This valuezero for non-enzyme design
