1. Overview
----------
UniDesign is a command-line-based Unified platform for protein Design, aiming at all kinds of protein design and engineering tasks, as well as for protein structure modeling and scoring. UniDesign is mainly extended from EvoEF2 (https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/EvoEF/) and in part from EvoDesign (https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/EvoDesign/) but has many new features. Please refer to manual.docx for more details about UniDesign.


2. Brief Applications
-------------
UniDesign can be used to do but is not limited to the following tasks:

2.1. Protein design (de novo protein sequence design and redesign):
*) design monomer proteins
*) design protein-protein interactions
*) design protein-ligand interactions
*) design protein-nucleic acid interactions
*) design enzymes

2.2. Protein structure modeling applications:
*) protein side-chain packing
*) repair missing protein side chains
*) protein structure energy minimization
*) build mutant structural models
*) add polar hydrogen atoms
*) optimize hydrogen atom's position

2.3. The scoring applications include:
*) calculate protein fold stability score
*) calculate protein-protein binding energy score
