1. Overview
----------
UniDesign is a universal framework for physics-based computational protein engineering, protein design, and sequence optimization. It is designed to target a diversity of functional protein design/engineering tasks, as well as for protein structure modeling and scoring. UniDesign is a strong extension of my previous computational protein design programs EvoEF2 (https://zhanggroup.org/EvoEF/) and EvoDesign (https://zhanggroup.org/EvoDesign/) with many more new features. Please refer to manual.docx for more details about UniDesign.


2. Brief Applications
-------------
UniDesign can be used to do but is not limited to the following tasks:

2.1. Protein design (de novo protein sequence design and redesign):
*) design monomer proteins
*) design protein-protein interactions
*) design protein-ligand interactions
*) design protein-nucleic acid interactions
*) design enzymes

2.2. Protein structure modeling applications:
*) protein side-chain packing
*) repair missing protein side chains
*) protein structure energy minimization
*) build mutant structural models
*) add polar hydrogen atoms
*) optimize hydrogen atom's position

2.3. The scoring applications include:
*) calculate protein fold stability score
*) calculate protein-protein binding energy score
